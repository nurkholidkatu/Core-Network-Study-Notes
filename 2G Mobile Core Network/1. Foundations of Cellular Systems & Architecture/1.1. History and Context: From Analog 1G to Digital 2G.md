## The Pre-2G Era: A Fragmented, Analog World

Before GSM was born, the mobile phone world was dominated by first-generation (**1G**) technology. These systems were *analog*, meaning your voice was converted into a continuous analog radio signal and transmitted through the air.

### Key Characteristics and Limitations of 1G Networks:
*   **Analog Technology:** Prone to interference (static noise), poor voice quality, and easy eavesdropping.
*   **No Global Standard:** Each country or region often developed its own incompatible system.
    *   **AMPS** (Advanced Mobile Phone System) in North America.
    *   **TACS** (Total Access Communication System) in the UK and parts of Asia.
    *   **NMT** (Nordic Mobile Telephony) in Nordic countries.
*   **No International Roaming:** A phone from one system would not work on another. An NMT user couldn't use their phone on a TACS network.
*   **Voice-Only Service:** No SMS or data services.
*   **Minimal Security:** No encryption; calls could be easily listened to by anyone with a radio scanner.
*   **Large Devices with Poor Battery Life.**

This fragmentation hindered innovation and economies of scale, creating a strong need for a new *global* standard.

## The Birth of GSM: A European Project That Went Global

The concept for GSM began as a European project. In 1982, the **Conférence Européenne des Administrations des Postes et des Télécommunications (CEPT)** formed a working group named **Groupe Spécial Mobile** (also abbreviated **GSM**). Its initial goal was to build a standardized *digital* cellular system that could work across all of Europe.

### Key Milestones in the Development of GSM:
