# üåê Core Network Study Notes

This repository contains a collection of study notes focused on **Core Networking** concepts and technologies, especially in the field of mobile communications.  
The materials are compiled from multiple sources, including:

- [3GPP Specifications](https://www.3gpp.org/)
- [Netmanias](https://www.netmanias.com/)
- Huawei Documentation
- Various books and references on mobile communication systems

The purpose of this repository is to organize and summarize my learning progress about core networks in a structured way.  
It is designed as both a personal knowledge base and a reference for others who are also studying mobile core network technologies.
